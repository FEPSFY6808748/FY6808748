<h3 id="Abstract">Abstract</h3>
  Over the last few years, we have heard that electric cars are the future and more environmentally friendly, but are they? Cars have been the most common form of transport for over 60 years <a href="#Gunn, 2018">(Gunn, 2018)</a> and play a massive part in taking over a billion people globally from A to B every day <a href="#Movotiv, 2021">Movotiv, 2021</a>. Here we discuss the role electric cars play in the future of automobiles and their advantages and disadvantages as the world transitions into a greener future.

<h3 id="Introduction":>Introduction</h3>
  There has been a long-standing debate about whether electric cars are more environmentally friendly than Diesel and Petrol vehicles and I will present some statistics from studies that answer this question. The answer is yes, sort of...
</p>

<p class="ex1">
<h3 id="Analysis and discussion">Analysis and discussion</h3>
  <p>
    <h4>1) Carbon emissions</h4>
    You see, this question is a multi-factorial question which can be thought of as a "closed-loop" system as illustrated in figure 1. In this chapter, we will consider the “CO2 emissions of the electric vehicle during operation.” Combustion engines in Diesel and Petrol vehicles emit a lot of Carbon dioxide <a href="#European Environment Agency, 2020">(European Environment Agency, 2020)</a>, and electric cars not only remove tailpipe carbon emissions <a href="#US Department of Energy, 2021">(US Department of Energy, 2021)</a> but operate at a much higher efficiency overall <a href="#Boloor, 2019">(Boloor, 2019)</a>. To understand why this is, we must understand how combustion engines and electric motors work. Combustion engines (see figure 2) have to burn compressed fuel, creating a small explosion in the cylinder which pushes a piston downwards and creates rotary motion by spinning a crankshaft that turns the wheels and a byproduct of this reaction is CO2 <a href="#Vehicle Technologies Office, 2013">(Vehicle Technologies Office, 2013)</a>. On the other hand, electric vehicles (see figure 3) use electrical energy stored in the battery pack to power an induction motor which uses a spinning electromagnet that reverses the poles at constant intervals <a href="#Energy Education">(Energy Education)</a>, to turn a crankshaft which turns the wheels as a result <a href="#US Department of Energy">(US Department of Energy)</a>. This difference in the way that combustion engines and electric motors work is the reason electric cars emit no CO2 during the operation of the vehicle however the question of whether this means they are more environmentally friendly is more complicated.

  </div>

  <p>
    <h4>2) Energy sources</h4>
    Next, coming back to our closed loop (figure 1) we will move on to Energy sources generating the electricity powering electric vehicles. This is an area that needs a lot more work done to reduce Carbon emissions as most energy used to power electric vehicles is generated from the burning of fossil fuels. In the UK 39% of electricity is generated from fossil fuels, 42% from renewables, and 19% from Nuclear and other sources <a href="#Department for Energy Security & Net Zero, 2023">(Deparment for Energy Security & Net Zero, 2023)</a> whereas in the US 60% of electricity production comes from burning fossil fuels, 20% from renewables and 20% from Nuclear and other sources <a href="#Center for Sustainable Systems, 2023">(Center for Sustainable Systems, 2023)</a>. More investment from governments and the private sector into renewables is required to reduce carbon emissions and get closer to achieving "net zero" <a href="#Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, 2023">(Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, 2023)</a>.
  </p>

  </div>

  <p>
    <h4>3) Battery recycling and raw materials</h4>
    Moving on to the next part of our closed-loop system, we have battery recycling which currently poses a challenge due to the lack of battery recycling facilities and infrastructure to meet the demand for used batteries that otherwise end up in landfills <a href="#Government Office for Science, 2023">(Government Office for Science, 2023)</a>. However, many companies in the private sector are stepping up to this challenge as a business opportunity such as Redwood Recycling <a href="#Redwood Recycling, 2023">(Redwood Recycling, 2023)</a>founded by JB Straubel, a former executive of Elon Musk's Tesla. With the right support in government funding towards the private sector, this problem is also solvable in the long term future. The argument against mining raw materials such as lithium, cobalt and nickel for EV batteries becomes less significant when taking into account that 80% of these metals in used battery packs can be repeatedly recycled <a href="#Eurostat, 2023">(Eurostat, 2023)</a> which in this sense means EV batteries can be very close to having net zero emissions over multiple lifetimes <a href="#National Grid, 2022">(National Grid, 2022)</a> whereas greenhouse gases released from the burning of petrol and diesel to power ICE vehicles exacerbates global warming unless you use carbon capture or offset methods to extract and recapture carbon in the atmosphere which can be a very costly process <a href="#Adam Baylin-Stern, 2021">(Adam Baylin-Stern, 2021)</a>. Furthermore, MIT has done a study that concludes that even considering the carbon emissions of mining the raw materials required to manufacture EVs and their battery packs, EVs still produce significantly less Carbon emissions in comparison to petrol and diesel vehicles across their lifetimes which means that in this sense, EVs are more environmentally friendly than ICE vehicles <a href="#Moseman, 2022">(Moseman, 2022)</a>.

  </div>

  <p>
    <h4>4) Price and performance</h4>
    Affordability and performance are critical factors for the widespread adoption of EVs. Innovations in the manufacturing process of EVs and EV batteries have driven costs down to as low as £30,000 and cheaper in the used market which is making electric vehicles accessible to people of median incomes <a href="#Office for Zero Emission Vehicles, 2022">(Office for Zero Emission Vehicles, 2022)</a>. Improvements in battery technology mean that many EVs can do over 300 miles on a single charge <a href="#Hill, 2023">(Hill, 2023)</a> more than addressing the needs of urban commuters doing short, daily commutes <a href="#Department for Transport, 2019">(Department for Transport, 2019)</a>. Innovations in charging technology have also resulted in EVs being able to reach a charge of 80% in as short as 20 minutes <a href="#Tesla, 2023">(Tesla, 2023)</a> and this technology will become mainstream for EVs moving forward surpassing yet another important hurdle <a href="#International Energy Agency, 2023">(International Energy Agency, 2023)</a>. It is also worth mentioning that most EV owners have a charging plug for their EVs so they can charge at home overnight without having to charge at an EV charging station or being subject to increasing gasoline prices which have been an increasing benefit of EVs, especially for the past year <a href="#International Energy Agency, 2023">(International Energy Agency, 2023)</a>.

  </div>

  <p>
    <h4>5) Conclusion</h4>
    Overall, EVs are set to become the future of transport as most automotive companies pledge to shift 100% of their product lines to electric vehicles from 2035 onwards <a href="#Department for Transport, 2023">(Department for Transport, 2023)</a>. Furthermore, to answer the main question of whether electric cars are really saving the environment, the answer is in theory, yes, but to make this a reality there is only one major problem left and that is shifting the energy sources used to generate electricity powering electric vehicles entirely to renewables which will become a reality with increased government investment into renewables moving forward <a href="#Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, 2023">(Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, 2023)</a>.
