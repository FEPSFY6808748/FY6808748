  Intro
  Over the last few years, we have heard that electric cars are the future and that they are more environmentally 
  friendly? But are they? Cars have been the most common form of transport for over 100 years and play a massive part
  in taking billions of people from A to B every single day. Today, we will be discussing the future of automobiles, 
  the role that electric cars play in this and their advantages and disadvantages as the world transitions into a 
  greener and more renewable future.

  1) Carbon emissions
  There has been a long standing debate about whether electric cars are more environmentally friendly than Diesel 
  and Petrol vehicles and in this chapter of the video I will present some statistics from studies that answer this 
  question. The answer is yes, kiind of... 
  You see, the question of whether electric cars are more enviromentally friendly than Diesel and Petrol vehicles
  is a multi-factorial question which I like to think of as a "closed-loop" system. Let me show you what I mean...
  Here, we can see the "CO2 emissions from mining the raw materials required to manufacture the electric vehicle 
  and battery pack that goes inside the vehicle" at the top of the loop which is connected to the "CO2 emissions of 
  the electric vehicle during operation" at the right side of the loop. The "CO2 emissions of the electric vehicle 
  during operation" is connected to "Battery and ev recycling" at the bottom of the loop which is finally connected 
  to "Energy sources that generate the electricity powering electric vehicles" at the left side of the loop. In this
  chapter of the video we will be talking about the CO2 emission of the electric vehicle during operation.

  You see combustion engines in Diesel and Petrol vehicles emit a lot of Carbon dioxide and electric cars not only 
  remove carbon emissions during the operation of the vehicle but in many cases operate at a much higher efficiency 
  overall. To truly understand why this is we have to understand how combustion engines and electric motors work. 
  Combustion engines (as suggested by the name) have to burn compressed fuel and air ignited by an electrical spark,
  creating a small explosion in the cylinder which pushes a piston downwards and creates rotary motion by spinning 
  a crankshaft that turns the wheels and a byproduct of this reaction is, you guessed it... CO2. 
  On the other hand, Electric vehicles use the electrical energy stored in the battery pack to power an induction 
  motor instead which uses a spinning electromagnet, which reverses the poles at constant intervals, to turn a 
  crankshaft once again which turns the wheels as a result. This distinct difference in the way that combustion 
  engines and electrical motors work is the reason electric cars emit less CO2 during the operation of the vehicle 
  however the question of whether this means they are more environmentally friendly is a more complicated question 
  as I will get into next.

  2) Energy sources
  Next, coming back to our closed loop we will move on to Energy sources generating the electricity powering electric
  vehicles. This is admittedly an area that needs a lot more work done in order to reduce Carbon emissions as most 
  energy used to power electric vehicles are generated from the burning of fossil fuels, in the UK specifically 
  around 60% of energy is generated from fossil fuels and 40% is generated from renewables whereas in the US its a 
  lot worse where 80% of total energy production comes from the burning of fossil fuels and only 20% is generated 
  from renewables. However, the issue of energy sources and fossil fuels is one that is easily fixable as the 
  solution to this is clear and that is investment. More investment from governments and the private sector into 
  renewables is required in order to drastically reduce carbon emissions and get closer to achieving "net zero". 

  3) Battery recycling and raw materials
  Moving on to the next part of the closed loop system we have Battery recycling and raw materials. Battery recycling
  is also an area that needs a lot of work as to clear up a common misconception the reason a lot of used batteries 
  end up in landfill is not that batteries cannot be recycled (as on average over 80% of the internal elements of a 
  battery can be recycled) but that there are currently not enough battery recycling facilities and the necessary 
  infrastructure to process and recycle all these batteries and meet demand. However, there are many companies in the 
  private sector that are stepping up to this challenge as a business opportunity and tackling this shortage of 
  battery recycling facilities such as Redwood recycling founded by a former executive of Elon Musk's Tesla and with
  the right support in government funding towards the private sector, this problem is also easily solvable in the 
  long term future.
  Another largely contested argument surrounding electric vehicles is the mining of raw materials such as Lithium,
  Cobalt and Nickel in order to manufacture the battery packs that go inside of electric vehicles this is sort of a
  redundant argument as the difference between ev's and icu's in this case is that lithium, cobalt and nickel in used
  battery packs can be repeatedly recycled over lifetimes whereas burning petrol and diesel in order to power a 
  vehicle cannot be reversed and once this takes place these fumes are released into the atmosphere which then leads
  to things like climate change and global warming which despite the refusal of many conspiracy theorists is a very
  REAL problem and has increased the frequency of a lot of natural disasters taking place as we have seen in the last
  decade which is ultimately detremental to humans and the environment. Furthermore MIT have done a study a few years
  ago that concludes that even considering the carbon emissions of mining the raw materials required to manufacture
  ev battery packs, ev's still produce a significantly less amount of Carbon emissions in comparison to petrol and 
  diesel vehicles across their lifetimes which means that in this sense ev's are more environmentally friendly than 
  petrol and diesel vehicles.

  4) Price and performace
  Finally in the last chapter of this video we will cover the price and performance of electric vehicles. The price 
  of a car is very important as in order for electric cars to become an option for working class people they need to
  be affordable enough and this has become a reality over the last 10 years as innovation in the production of ev's 
  and the manufacturing of the batteries used inside of them has driven costs down to as low as 20-£30,000 and even 
  cheaper in the used market which is now starting to make electric vehicles accessible to most people of median 
  incomes in many western countries. Performance in electric vehicles have also improved dramatically as many 
  electric vehicles can now do over 300 miles on a single charge which is more than enough for most people living in
  urban areas and doing short daily commutes which statistics show is the case a majority of the time. A notorious 
  area of debate from ev critics is ev charging which has also seen massive improvements over the last decade thanks 
  to innovations from Tesla in charging technology where electric vehicles can now be charged up to 80% in as short 
  15 minutes and this technology will become mainstream for ev's moving forward making this argument redundant once 
  again and its also worth mentioning that most ev owners have a charging plug for their ev's that they use to charge
  their ev's overnight so most of the time as long as you are aware of how many charges you have left you can just 
  charge at home overnight without having to charge at a ev charging station or being subject to increasing gas 
  prices which have been an increasing benefit of ev's especially for the last year.

  5) Conclusion
  Overall Ev's are set to become the future of transport as most automotive companies are set to shift all their 
  vehicle productions to electric vehicles from 2030 onwards. Furthermore, to answer the main question of whether 
  electric cars are really saving the environment, the answer is in theory is yes but in order to make this a reality
  there only one major problem left to make electric cars truly and definitively more environmentally friendly than
  petrol and diesel vehicles which is shifting the energy sources used to generate the electricity used to power 
  electric vehicles entirely to renewables which will become a reality with increased government investment into 
  renewables moving forward.
